CyclisticBikeShare
Introduction
This exploratory analysis case study is towards Capstome project requirement for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The case study involves a bikeshare company's data of its customer's trip details over a 12 month period (April 2020 - March 2021). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.

Scenario
Marketing team needs to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ.

Objective
Hence, my objective for this analysis is to throw some light on how the two types of customers: annual members and casual riders, use Cyclistic bikeshare differently, based on few parameters that can be calculated/ obtained from existing data.

Data Sources
A total of 12 datasets have been made available for each month starting from April 2020 to March 2021. Each dataset captures the details of every ride logged by the customers of Cyclistic. This data that has been made publicly available has been scrubbed to omit rider's personal information.

Documentation, Cleaning and Preparation of data for analysis
The combined size of all the 12 datasets is close to 600 MB. Data cleaning in spreadsheets will be time-consuming and slow compared to SQL or R. I am choosing R simply because I could do both data wrangling and analysis/ visualizations in the same platform. It is also an opportunity for me to learn R better.
